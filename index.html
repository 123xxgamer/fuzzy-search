    <p>What is fuzzy searching?</p>
      <ul class="checks">
        <li>Often when searching through a list of data, people aren't only looking for exact matches, but also for approximate matches if they wish to prevent accidental misspells, or if they wish to find all applicable results.</li>
        <li>Fuzzy searching is a useful and practical solution. It allows the user to set a custom minimum percentage they wish for results to match their input, before the search happens, allowing the user to control how restrictive or how diverse the results are.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>An overview of my program's utility:</p>
      <ul class="checks">
        <li>You can choose the specific percent similarity you're looking for!</li>
	<li>Don't worry about whitespace --- it is automatically disregarded!</li>
        <li>You can alter other parameters such as choosing to disregard capitalization.</li>
	<li>You can even specify which database to compare your answer to from my optional drop-down menu!</li>
      </ul>
