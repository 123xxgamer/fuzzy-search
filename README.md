# Foundations of Computer Science II Final Project
#### Name0: Andy Zhou

#### Period: 9

#### Project Overview
We will design a web page that allows the user to input a certain word and/or phrase of their choosing, and get an output comprised of multiple words/phrases that have at least an x% match with the user's input, from our existing database. This is essentially a search tool for x% partial matches within some list. The user will have separate text boxes to input their desired minimum % similarity. They will also be able to further pre-filter the output results with options such as to disregard whitespace, disregard capitalization, etc.

#### Tool Usage
- Will you be using matplotlib or forms (or both?).
-   We will be using form(s) to collect user data. Forms include textbox(es), checkbox(es), and possibly drop-down menu(s), all of which allow the user to pre-screen results before we output them. We might be using matplotlib to add extra features for the webpage, but likely not. We will also be using the difflib library, though we might consider coding this tinction ourselves.
- How will you be using the topics covered in class?
-   We will be using html and css to make our website, which consists of a homepage (where we describe the purpose of the website) and a program page (where the user can input desired data and receive appropriate output). Strings will be collected for analysis and comparison against our existing files, comprised of data structures.
