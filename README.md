# Fuzzy Search Utility
#### By: 123xxgamer

#### Project Overview
I designed a web page that allows the user to input a certain word and/or phrase of their choosing, and get an output comprised of multiple words/phrases that have at least an x% match with the user's input, from our existing database. This is essentially a search tool for x% partial matches within some list. The user will have separate text boxes to input their desired minimum % similarity. They will also be able to further pre-filter the output results with options such as to disregard whitespace, disregard capitalization, etc.
